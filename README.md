# Fixed:
- Prevously user could not controll the player in the web version, now it is fixed. Due to godot bug, there in no way to hide the mouse on web.

- Prevously user could spam the keys and the player would glitch and move while user is pressing nothing. Now it is fixed.

# Features:
- Old Character Controller
